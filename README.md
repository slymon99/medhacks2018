## Project Mission

This project was developed for the Medhacks 2018 hackathon on September 8-9, 2018.

Our project is inspired by the lack of nutritious food available to low income individuals due to distance from a supermarket or lack of transportation, also known as food deserts or healthy food priority areas. People in these regions must either travel great distances by foot or by bus in order to get more nutritious food, or forgo their recommended servings of produce, and suffer great health impacts over time. 

Our approach to this issue is to create a cost-effective manner to enable individuals in these areas to purchase sufficient servings of healthy food for their week and have it delivered to a more convenient location in their community in a cost-effective manner. This application can be further extended to those who do not have adequate time in their busy schedules to go grocery shopping
